# Gnome Shell Extension template

> [!CAUTION]
>
> If you want your extension to be accepted on
> [extensions.gnome.org](https://extensions.gnome.org/), you cannot use this
> template or Gnim. Unfortunately, their review guidelines require transpiled
> JavaScript to remain human-readable, which is currently not possible due to
> how build tools work. Reviewers also discourage bundling, so working around
> the inclusion of Gnim makes things even more complicated.
